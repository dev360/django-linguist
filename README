The goal of this project is to provide basic localization support for your models in a transparent fashion.

This is achieved by specifying a one-to-many relationship between your model and the translations, and by
building in basic support for viewing this relationship into the django admin.

This project is in production use, but code may change as it matures. Please see the tests/testproject 
files to get an idea of how to set it up.

The completed features as of right now are:
	- Support for specifying the model and the translation models
	- Admin support for tabs which do not require multiple posts
	  in order to fill out all the translations for an object.
	- You can make one or more languages required to force the
	  user to enter them by setting the TRANSLATION_REQUIRED_LANGUAGES
	  property

Outstanding issues / missing features:
	- A middleware that you can access the current language from
	- Custom manager that would allow for more convenient access
	  of localized content.
	- Need to decide on a syntax for accessing translated content
