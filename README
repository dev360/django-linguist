The goal of this project is to provide basic localization support for your models in a transparent fashion.

This is achieved by specifying a one-to-many relationship between your model and the translations, and by
building in basic support for viewing this relationship into the django admin.

This project is merely a proof of concept at this stage. Please see the tests/testproject files to get an
idea of how this works.

The completed features as of right now are:
	- Support for specifying the model and the translation models
	- Admin support for tabs which do not require multiple posts
	  in order to fill out all the translations for an object.
	

Outstanding issues / missing features:
	- A middleware that you can access the current language from
	- Custom manager that would allow for more convenient access
	  of localized content.
	- Better presentation of validation errors in admin.
	- Add hidden field to InlineForm that indicate whether
	  the model has been changed or not. Right now, it will
	  throw error since the hidden field on the page contains
	  the locale.
	- Need to decide on a syntax for accessing translated content
